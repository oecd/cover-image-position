# Cover image positioning help

A basic page that allows a potential image to be placed within a template of a publication to determine its position and size.

This can be tested (and used?) by going here: 
* http://jfix.github.io/cover-image-position/index.html or
* http://rawgit.com/jfix/cover-image-position/master/index.html

There are obviously still a lot of things to do, depending on the needs. But for a proof-of-concept this will suffice.
